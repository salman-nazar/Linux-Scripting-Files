# Linux-Scripting-Files
Scripting Files automate system configuration. Run multiple commands in sequence. IP address configuration in scripts can be static or dynamic (DHCP). These scripts often use utilities like ip, ifconfig, or modify network configuration files directly.

I make two scripting files in this repo, one for the input scripts (for writing script) and other for display it.

This script I write generally shows you the available IP's which are not ping by any network. We also check it by running 'ping' command but script is much easier to check it you dont have to write commmands for that. For Running Scripting Files We type: './FileName.script'
